        <li>
            <strong>Step 1</strong> <p>
                Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 2</strong> <p>
                Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 3</strong> <p>
                Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 4</strong> <p>
                Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 5</strong> <p>
                Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 6</strong> <p>
                Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 7</strong> <p>
                Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
            </p>
